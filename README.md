# Mindustry Mod - Armored Basic Conveyor

This is a mod for the Anuke's **Mindustry** game. **Please be aware this mod is still a work in progress!**

Mindustry is a sandbox resource management game, spiced with tower defense and RTS mechanics. It's a great game and a lot of fun, definitely check it out on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/).

Also check its source code (and readme!) on [GitHub](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry).

## About

Armored conveyor is a simple mod that adds exactly one block to the game - Armored Basic Conveyor. Much like its mid-to-late-game cousin, the Armored Conveyor, this conveyor belt sports not just better durability - but most importantly - **doesn't accept any items from the sides, except from other conveyor belts**.

### Why?

This mod exists because... I believe this item is essential for building more complex conveyor nets and is missing in the early campaign (before appropriate research), as well as early game (before fabricating Plastanium).

### Why does this mod contain only a single block?

The focus of this mod is conveyor network management, rather than frontline fortification (there are already conveyor belts for that in the vanilla game). I haven't thought of any other block in this category (distribution network quality of life changes, not distribution network fortification) that would deserve adding (yet). Let's be honest, the base game has done a pretty good job in this.

## Supported game versions

The mod has been tested with the game version 5, release `104.6`. For the minimum game version, see [mod's main file](mod.json) in detail.

**"These locations differ from those on the official wiki!"**

Yes, that is because I just checked the actual location for the Windows Steam version. Cannot vouch for the rest, though I assume they will follow the same directory structure. The wiki might need an update.
