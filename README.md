## About

Armored Basic Conveyor is a simple mod that adds two new early-game blocks to both Survival and Campaign - the **Armored Basic Conveyor** and the **Plated Basic Conduit**. Much like their mid-to-late-game counterparts, these blocks don't feature just better durability - but most importantly - **they don't accept any inputs from the sides, except from other conveyors/conduits**. The Plated Basic Conduit also doesn't leak.

## Blocks

For list of all blocks in the mod, see the [blocks](docs/blocks.md) documentation.
