# Mindustry Mod - Armored Basic Conveyor

This is a mod for the Anuke's **Mindustry** game. Mindustry is a sandbox resource management game, spiced with tower defense and RTS mechanics. It's a great game and a lot of fun, definitely check it out on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/).

Also check its source code (and readme!) on [GitHub](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry).

## About

Armored Basic Conveyor is a simple mod that adds two new blocks to both Survival and Campaign - the **Armored Basic Conveyor** and the **Plated Basic Conduit**. Much like their mid-to-late-game counterparts, these blocks don't feature just better durability - but most importantly - **they don't accept any inputs from the sides, except from other conveyors/conduits**. The Plated Basic Conduit also doesn't leak.

### Why?

I believe the value of armored/plated blocks is not in their extra health/speed, but in allowing you to build more complex and compact structures. This is missing in the early campaign (before appropriate research), as well as early game (before fabricating Plastanium).

## Supported game versions

The mod has been tested with the game version 6, release `105` and up.

**"These locations differ from those on the official wiki?"**

Yes, that is because I just checked the actual location for the Windows Steam version. Cannot vouch for the rest, though I assume they will follow the same directory structure. The wiki might need an update.
